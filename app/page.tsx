            </h2>
            <p className="section-lede">
              Former photographer and fashion designer turned Product Designer —
              same eye for framing, now applied to human-centred design.
            </p>

            <div className="about-copy">
              <p>
                As a former photographer and fashion designer, I&apos;ve always
                been passionate about framing things correctly and understanding
                people. As a Product Designer, I bring that same eye to solving
                business problems through human-centred design — focusing not just
                on the final deliverable, but on delivering value throughout the
                entire process: from framing the right problem and aligning user
                needs with business goals, to prototyping, testing, and iterating
                to improve outcomes.
              </p>
              <p>
                With 6 years delivering high-impact products across Healthcare,
                AI, Real Estate, Financial Services, Retail, and Transportation,
                I combine user research, competitive analysis, and strategic
                thinking to build solutions that scale as businesses grow. Working
                in dual-track discovery, I lead cross-functional collaboration
                across design, product, and engineering — shipping on time and
                within budget while anticipating future needs, reducing technical
                debt, and maximizing ROI for startups and enterprises.
              </p>
              <p>
                My work spans the full product design cycle: design strategy,
                problem framing, design systems, interaction design,
                accessibility, and developer handoff — always with a focus on
                measurable impact and long-term product thinking.
